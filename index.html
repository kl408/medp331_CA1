                <p>NONONO's website is <span style="color: #da5c36; font-weight: bold;">static</span> due to its simple usage of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a lack of databases
                    and <span style="color: #da5c36; font-weight: bold;">limited functionality</span>. Services that may require databases such as deliveries or reservations are
                    linked to other websites instead.
                </p>
                <p>I'm a fan of this site as it is a great way to see the restaurant's ambience and it has great pictures
                    of their food! (I'd recommend their curry udon!) Scrolling through menus could be more accessible
                    however.

                <img style="height: 60%; width: 60%;" src="https://cms.qz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Discord.png?quality=75&strip=all&w=1600&h=900&crop=1">
                <p>Note: The site is much more dynamic when you are logged in.</p> 
                <p>Discord is a very <span style="color: #5865F2; font-weight: bold;">dynamic</span> application as it holds many functions to connect users to servers. As a
                    messaging platform, it requires complex code and <span style="color: #5865F2; font-weight: bold;">great use of databases</span>.
                </p>
                <p>I use Discord daily and I love how easy it is to navigate through to talk to my friends and edit
                    our own group chats to our preferences!
